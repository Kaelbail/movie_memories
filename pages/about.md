## About the Collection

This collection consists of 28 movie ticket stubs collected over the span of about a decade, beginning in 2014 up to the present year, 2022. This is only a small sample of the larger collection, which will be added to the site in the near future. The tickets range in variety based on location and name of theaters visited, the genre(s) and ratings of the movies viewed, the price of each ticket purchased, as well as the addtional descriptive information included in the text on each ticket. This collection allows me, the creator, to visualize my personal preferences and how they changed and adapted with time. In the next section, I detail how this collection might also benefit and be of interest to various potential user groups. 

## Potential Users

Aside from those who enjoy ticket collections for the novelty and unique aspects of the items, this particular collection may be of use to economists who study cost trends over time as they apply to leisurely expenditures such as movie tickets. The hope is that this collection will continue to grow with time and may attract a very diverse user base including scholars, researchers, entrepreneurs, business scholars, and the general public. This collection would make for an interesting comparison of theaters in Indiana since almost all of the movies took place somewhere in the state. There may even be potential for a collection like this to benefit someone studying the materials used in printing tickets to see the effects of time on the visibility of the ink since they were all stored in same place, under the same conditions, and yet some deteriorated much faster than others.

## About the Creator

My name is Kaela Bailey, and I am a second year graduate student at Indiana University in Bloomington, IN. I am studying Library Information Science and this digital collection is my attempt at putting into practice my lessons on .html, markdown, and digital repositories. I enjoy moving out of my confort zone when it comes to digital aspects of library science, so this project was a great way for me to gain confidence in approaching digital collections in the future. This collection was so fun for me to work with because I have been collecting movie ticket stubs since I was a young child. Unfortunately,I no longer have most of them, but the 50 or so tickets I do have allow me to recognize interesting trends in movie prices, pick up on patterns of personal interests being formed through the years, and to relive fond memories from the past decade or so.

### Rights Information

The use of my collection (historical preservation and research purposes) will allow most of these tickets to fall under Fair Use. These ticket stubs fall under public domain once the showtime is over since the ticket then becomes void. However, some tickets include logos and images, so I had to make sure they did not fall under copyright law before digitizing them. Here is what I found for AMC tickets according to their website (https://www.amctheatres.com/terms-and-conditions):

Some of the tickets provide copyright information and fair use information in text on the back. After reading up on the coopyright and fair use agreements associated with these tickets, I am certain they raise no concerns within this collection.
